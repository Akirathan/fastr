# Specify output filters for R package testing
# 
# Format (EBNF, sed-like action syntax): 
# filter = pkg_pattern '=>' action .
# pkg_pattern = <REGEX>.
# action = command '/' string ['/' string ].
# command = 'd' | 'D' | 'r' | 'R'
# string = <unquoted string, slashed must be escaped with backslash>
# 
# Command description:
#   d   delete exact match of the specified string (i.e. replace by empty string)
#   D   delete line containing the specified string
#   r   replace exact match of the first argument by the second argument
#   R   replace line containing the first argument by the second argument
#
# NOTES:
# The definition order of the filters (in this file) matters. 
# They will be applied in order.
