# L_initGrid gets environment from its caller, which is .External, and saves it 
# into a static variable R_gridEvalEnv without calling R_PreserveObject. In the 
# Gnu R world, the environment actually cannot be garbage collected, because it 
# is grid's environment and there are references to it.
# 
# Moreover, grid also uses this environment to "preserve" other objects just by 
# adding them to that environment. See ed_state where we fix code doing this to 
# also call R_PreserveObject and R_ReleaseObject.
