fficall contains the implementation of the R FFI, as described in https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html.

 There are two sub-directories:
   common
   jni

 'jni' contains the implementation that is based on Java JNI. 'common' contains code that has no JNI dependencies and has been extracted for
 reuse in other implementations. Note however, that the common files cannot all be compiled in isolation, as they may depend on the implementation
 via rffiutils.h. During the build symbolic links are made to the files in common and they are compiled with the other 'jni' files.

 The R FFI is rather baroque and defined in large set of header files in the sibling 'include' directory. In GnuR, the implementation
 of the functions is spread over the GnuR C files in 'src/main'. To ease navigation of the FastR implementation, in general, the implementation
 of the functions in a header file 'Rxxx.h' is stored in the file 'Rxxx.c'.

The points of entry from Java are defined in the file rfficall.c. Various utility functions are defined if rffiutils.{h,c}.

TODO

Refactor the files that are copied from GnuR and not strictly part of the FFI but support the native graphics package.
